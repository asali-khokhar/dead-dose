# Dead Dose

Dead Dose is a 3D top-down rhythm RPG! Development is currently on hiatus - the project is large and whilst I learnt a lot making it, I'd rather pursue smaller projects before returning to it.

My intention in creating Dead Dose is as an homage to games I've played in the past, namely, Undertale, Omori, Buddy Simulator 1984, and more; games with striking OSTs combined with moving stories that left the player with a strong sense of catharsis. 

The game is written in C#, using Unity, and features a Player FSM, alongside a test level, featuring dialogue, scene changes, collision, music, etc, health management, etc. The player FSM handles player movement, as well as a dash, taking damage, and invulnerability frames.
